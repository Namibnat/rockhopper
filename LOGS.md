# LOGS


## 29 October 2021

* Started out doing some pointer experiments.  It's been a few years since I've done
  much in C, and I want to be sure that I know exactly what's what.


## 28 October 2021

* I've had a tough day at work, and so my brain just isn't up to much being clever. So I'm just
  trying to make progress on simple stuff.
* First thing today was just updating my readme.  A good activity for rough days.
* Move imports to a header file.
* 

## 27 October 2021

* Again, mostly working on work, though I am doing some reading up on compilers tonight.


## 26 October 2021

* I used up all my free time on work, so no progress.


## 25 October 2021

* Iterate over the read buffer, as a move towards clearing comments
* Skip // comments in the input buffer
* Skip /* comments until */ in the input buffer


## 24 October 2021

* Just reviewed pointers, and concepts like double pointers


## 23 October 2021

* Refactor to separate the file read.
* Working on clear comments
* Getting the hang of passing strings through pointers


## 22 October 2021

* Add a 'testfile' to work with, and just start with a comment line
* Add a scanner routine to read the file, and produce a stream of tokens
* Add minimal read and close expressions
* Read the 'testfile'
* Create a function to clear comments, and lay out the basic logic for it


## 21 October 2021

* Started the project, created a github repo, and set up minimal code.
* Added a simple makefile
