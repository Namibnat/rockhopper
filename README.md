# Compile a subset of c

I'm in compilers.  I've tried to
write bits of compilers in the past, but generally, I ended up not
having much time to commit to it.

Now I have more free time, and so I plan to commit two hours each day
to both learning about compilers and implementing a subset of a c
compiler for myself.

Inspired by [this post on writing a c compiler][self-hosting-c-compiler], I thought
I'd not only build one but try to write about it.  It might end up being an essay
on my own website at some stage.  You'll be able to see my progress on my 'LOGS.md' page.

A big goal is to try to work in really small steps.  So much so, you might find this post really
boring.
